Katharine Egan & Ashley Marranzino
Katharine walked me through the use-cases of MaxEnt and was generally super helpful with advice on SDMs with NCRMP data!


Takeaways
-	Cannot really use Maxent for abundance/cover – there’s a piecemeal way, but not advised. Also not recommended if you have absence data
-	But it’s very useful to get the lay of the land with this kind of modeling, and start to identify which kinds of environmental predictors are going to be the most useful
-	Should really land on GAMs, re: discussion with Kelsey Roberts at LSU.
