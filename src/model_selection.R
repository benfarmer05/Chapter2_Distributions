  #packages to consider for model selection / cross validation:
  
  #glmnet
  #tidymodels (perhaps the standard)
  #consider GLMs, zero-inflated poisson
  #but also consider that in an ideal world, I could delineate true absences (unsuitable habitat)
  #   from unexplained absences (absences in habitat that is seemingly suitable). I don't necessarily
  #   have much of the the former, and I'm not sure how I would explictly model either one
